# EllipticCurveCryptography
We will use "ECDH" and "AES" standard algorithm in this project.

**CRYPTOGRAPHY**
  It provide us mechanism to send sensitive data through insecure network.

**ELLIPTICCURVECRYPTOGRAPHY**
  Elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) is a public key encryption technique 
  based on elliptic curve theory that can be used to create faster, smaller, and more efficient cryptographic keys.

**ECDH**

**AES**
  AES is a symmetric key encryption cipher, and it is generally regarded as the “gold standard” for encrypting data.
